## Project Plan: Real-Time Analysis of Social Media Data for Sentiment and Trend Analysis

### **Objective:**
Develop a scalable system for analyzing large-scale real-time social media data using Apache Spark for big data processing and machine learning techniques for sentiment and trend analysis. The system will include a real-time data pipeline, machine learning models, and a dashboard to present actionable insights.

### **Key Deliverables:**

1. **Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Integration of Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.
   - Apache Spark for stream processing of social media data.

2. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Sentiment analysis or trend prediction using MLlib or scikit-learn.

3. **Cloud-Based Deployment**
   - Deployment of the big data pipeline on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

4. **Interactive Real-Time Dashboard**
   - Data visualization using Tableau, Power BI, or similar tools.

5. **Final Project Report**
   - Comprehensive documentation covering analysis, insights, and lessons learned.
